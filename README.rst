Quest Project
=============

This project builds on the open-source work of `Ariel Roffé <https://arielroffe.quest>`_,
who developed the original game and website concept.  
Many thanks to Ariel for making his code, design, and assets publicly available,
which made this adaptation possible.

The original game was created using the **Phaser 3** game engine, with assets
sourced from public domain repositories, edited tilesets, and music remixes
(see Ariel’s site for full credits and licensing).

Academic Adaptation – Spring 2025
---------------------------------

This version of the project has been adapted as part of my academic work for
the course **Microbial Symbiosis and Microbiomes (Spring 2025)**.  
The game framework has been re-imagined as an educational platform, where players
explore the fascinating partnerships between microbes and hosts through
interactive storytelling.

The adaptation demonstrates how open-source game engines and creative assets
can be repurposed to communicate complex biological concepts, bridging science,
education, and playful design.  
It will be available on my personal website as a demonstration of academic and
outreach-oriented digital projects.
